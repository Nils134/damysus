## Overview

Create a robust blockchain relying on n=2f+1. This is done by prohibiting equivocation, allowing us to remove a phase out of the Hotstuff protocol and using less replicas than the traditional n=3f+1 configuration, where f is the number of faulty replicas. This protocol prevents equivocation by certifying each message using a trusted component. The replica is described in the APP directory, whereas the trusted component is defined in the Enclave directory. Additionally, there is an experiments.py file that configures the proper replicas and trusted components.

Terms/abbreviations to consider:
Ch: chained
OP: OnePhase
R: round
V: view
Cheap: CHECKER
Quick: ACCUMULATOR
Free: Light-Damysus (no hash and signatures)
TVL: throughput versus latency


## Blockchain Application

### 1. Introduction

The Damysus protocol has several phases per view. During each a leader will propose a set of transactions to confirm. This is done in the prepare phase. This is then sent to all other participating replicas. After this, the backups confirm the set of transactions and prepare a response using their trusted component, which they send to the leader. The leader collects responses, and send a combination of these replies to the other replicas. These receive this combination, store this in their trusted component, which concludes the pre-commit phase. This store is send to the leader, which collects and combines these stores to communicate to the other replicas in the decide phase. If the replicas receive a valid combination in this decide phase, they execute the set of transactions and reply to external clients. This concludes the decide phase. After this, the new-view phase starts, where a new leader collects new-view messages from replicas

## SGX Trusted Component

### 1. Introduction

The SGX trusted component prohibits the equivocation, by only allowing one signature to be applied per view/phase combination. Asking for extra signatures will be ignored. It can also keep track of the latest prepared and locked block. Additionally, it can act as an accumulator, which allows a replica to independently verify the latest block out of several collected new-view messages. 

### 2. Directory Structure

Within the Enclave structure, an Enclave private RSA key is stored in Enclave_private.pem. EnclaveShare.h provides the methods, that are in different configurations implemented in all cpp files.
