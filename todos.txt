List of things:

Call heartbeat after epoch of f+u+1
Create RECOVER and WISH messages 
    Recover: type + nonce to all leaders within an epoch 
    Wish: type + previous_epoch to all leaders within an epoch

Create TC message that leaders can send after a Wish treshold
    TC: type + Recovers + view of start of epoch

Create vote for TC message
    sign TC message (used for forking prevention) after checks to all leaders

After threshold of TC votes:
    send QC to all (including self)

After QC:
    adopt view of epoch if not replaced by new TEE

TODOs Handler:
add functions for Heartbeat protocol to send/receive messages
    - handle message collection at replica, supply list of messages to TEE
        -check Comb variant for message collection

add callTEE functions for newly defined TEE methods
    - think about required parameters

think of some way to allow faulty and unresponsive TEEs to occasionally trigger restarts 

Damysus uses logs to store messages up to quorum size (this->log in Handler.cpp)
    - TODO: add storage functionality and other methods related to Comb for RBF

Create Peers list method that only includes leaders of an epoch 

Fix stats.h for wish and recovery messages
